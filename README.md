**Setting up software development team in the marketing department in Paymentsense**  (June 2016 - June 2017)

This opportunity was probably one of the most challenging and rewarding ones. The task was to set up an entirely new team of developers outside of the IT department, including implementing new tech solution for customer facing websites and hiring a team of 4 software developers + QA. 
Working with my team of 5 individuals of different skills and personalities, taught me the importance of cross team collaboration and how nothing is impossible when you tackle a problem as a group. 

**Working on new version of SIMS in Capita**  (Oct 2014 - Dec 2014)

My very first contract role. It was incredibly satisfying to work on a product which meant a big change for a lot of school employees. SIMS 8 was a transition from decade old, self-hosted windows application to asp.net web application with a thoughtfully designed & modern ux/ui. 

The challenge was building a product which was fully accessible, supported internationalisation, quick data input, large amounts of data, performance and memory focused - which was all new to me,  and also the first time I got to focus on mobile first development, explore possibilities of css pre-processors and learn principles of OOCSS.
